## DReact

Just a toy project I spun up to play around with React.  The sequencer is built with the NexusUI wrapper and ideally the timing will utilize ToneJS or a similar framework in due time but the app is currently in a useable state.  Have fun and make some noise!  If this gets any real use I may add a recording feature & a way to share your beats with friends!
